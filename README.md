Project title
	Visualize Trails


Project description
	Bush (1945) envisioned a device that individuals would compress and store all of their books, records, and communications. The device, which called memex, should be able to store the information in sequential(step-wise) as well as parelell(trail-wise) fashions. Our team tried to come up with an idea to create memex in the most natural and also convenient way. We built a browser plugin as a trail maker so that we can store instantly and assign different trails on the spot from the browser. Also, we built a trail browser page which dynamically visualize the richness (or quantity) of the each trail and show the trail in a sequential way. Using these tools we believe that we can create and revisit our thought trails, and also we can share and collaborate on it with friends as well.
